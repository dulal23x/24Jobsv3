# 24Jobs Frontend

This repository contains only the frontend portion of the 24Jobs application. The backend is managed separately and must be set up locally by each team member.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Backend Setup (Local Only)

Team members need to:
1. Obtain the backend code separately
2. Set up the backend environment locally
3. Run the backend server

## Repository Structure

This repository is configured to track only frontend-related files to reduce GitHub storage usage. The `.gitignore` file is set up to exclude all backend code while keeping the necessary frontend files.

## Development Workflow

When working on this project:
1. Only commit frontend changes to this repository
2. Backend changes should be managed separately
3. Keep both frontend and backend synchronized in your local development environment
