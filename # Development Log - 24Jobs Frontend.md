# Development Log - 24Jobs Frontend

This log tracks significant changes and troubleshooting steps during development, particularly focusing on frontend authentication and the People page.

## Recent Activity (Approx. [Current Date - Check Summary for Context])

**Goal:** Implement a user authentication context (`AuthContext`) to manage user roles and credits, integrate it into the `People.tsx` page, and fix related rendering errors.

**Initial Problem:** The `People.tsx` page was failing to render due to unresolved imports (`sonner` and `@/contexts/AuthContext`) and later due to the `useAuth` hook being called outside of its provider.

**Steps & Changes:**

1.  **`sonner` Import Error:**
    *   **Issue:** Vite reported `[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "sonner" from "src/pages/People.tsx"`.
    *   **Resolution Attempt:** Identified that the `sonner` package likely needed installation (`npm install sonner`). Guided the user to run the installation command in their `frontend` directory terminal. *(Self-correction: AI cannot directly install)*.

2.  **`AuthContext` Import Error:**
    *   **Issue:** Vite reported `[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "@/contexts/AuthContext" from "src/pages/People.tsx"`. This indicated the `AuthContext.tsx` file was either missing, in the wrong location, or the path alias `@` was not configured correctly in `vite.config.js` or `tsconfig.json`.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Provided code to create a basic `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` file. This included:
            *   Defining `User` and `AuthContextType` interfaces.
            *   Creating the `AuthContext` using `createContext`.
            *   Implementing a dummy `AuthProvider` component with hardcoded 'developer' role and initial credits (`{ role: 'developer', credits: 1000 }`).
            *   Exporting the `useAuth` hook for consuming the context.

3.  **`useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider` Error:**
    *   **Issue:** The browser console showed `Uncaught Error: useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider` originating from `People.tsx`. This meant the `People` component (or one of its parents) was trying to use the `AuthContext` before the `AuthProvider` was added higher up in the component tree.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Modified `frontend/src/App.tsx` to wrap the main application structure (likely the router or layout components) with the `<AuthProvider>` component imported from `./contexts/AuthContext`. This ensures the context is available to all child components, including `People.tsx`.

4.  **Integrating Auth into `People.tsx`:**
    *   Modified `frontend/src/pages/People.tsx`:
        *   Imported and called `useAuth` to get the `user` object: `const { user, updateLocalCredits } = useAuth();` (Note: `updateLocalCredits` was added to the context later or assumed based on the code).
        *   Updated the `handleUnlockContact` function:
            *   Added checks for `user` existence and `user.credits_remaining > 0` before attempting the unlock API call.
            *   Added `toast` notifications for login requirements and insufficient credits.
            *   Included placeholder comments for adding authentication headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) to the `fetch` request.
            *   Updated the state updates on successful unlock to use the potentially returned `unlockedData` and called `updateLocalCredits(user.credits_remaining - 1)` (assuming `updateLocalCredits` exists in the context to update the frontend state immediately).
        *   Updated the "Unlock Contact" button:
            *   Changed its appearance (styling) and `disabled` state based on whether the contact is already unlocked (`showContactInfo[person.id]`), if the user is logged in (`!user`), and if they have credits (`user.credits_remaining <= 0`).
            *   Modified the button text to indicate unlock status or credit cost.

**Outcome:** The dummy `AuthProvider` allows the `People` page to render without the `useAuth` error. The component now attempts to use the user's (currently dummy) authentication status and credits to control the contact unlocking feature.

**Next Steps:**

*   Replace the dummy `AuthProvider` with actual authentication logic (e.g., fetching user data on login, handling tokens).
*   Implement the backend API endpoint (`/api/people/{id}/unlock/`) including authentication checks and credit deduction logic.
*   Verify the path alias `@` configuration in `vite.config.js` or `tsconfig.json` if import issues persist.
*   Ensure the `updateLocalCredits` function is correctly implemented in `AuthContext.tsx` if it's needed for immediate UI feedback on credit changes.
